## Description 

### Purpose 
The code in this file aims to serve as a practice to use C++ OOP features. It is following the content in *Ch6.4 A Second Example Class: A Class of Complex Numbers* in the book [Guide to Scientific Computing in C++](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-73132-2)

Note that C++ STL already has the features for complex numbers. The code in this folder is just serving as an exercise for practicing the C++ OOP organization.
